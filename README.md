# Cepstrum-and-Wavelet-Transform-Frequency-Analysis-of-Brain-Signals
In this repository, we delve into the exploration of Wavelet Transform and Short-Time Fourier Transform. We then examine several examples of Fourier analysis applications, including Dual Tone Multi-Frequency and image compression. Finally, we investigate the frequency domain of the EEG signal and discuss the Cepstrum transformation.
